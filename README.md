# User Workspace

## Project Overview
User Workspace is a Node.js application designed to handle user requests and file uploads with ease. Leveraging the Express framework, this application provides a robust backend that can manage various user-related functionalities while also integrating third-party libraries for handling file operations and environment configurations.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/user-workspace.git
   cd user-workspace
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies** using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory to configure environment variables if necessary.

## Usage

To start the application, run the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
This will launch the server on the default port (usually `3000`). You can access the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

- **File Uploads**: Utilizes `multer` for handling multipart/form-data, allowing users to upload files easily.
- **RESTful API**: Structure your application to handle different user-related API requests seamlessly.
- **Environment Variables**: Use `dotenv` to manage configurations securely.
- **Async HTTP Requests**: Make requests to external APIs using the `axios` library.
  
## Dependencies

This project uses the following primary dependencies:

- **axios**: ^1.9.0 - Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
- **dotenv**: ^16.5.0 - Module to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **express**: ^5.1.0 - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **multer**: ^2.0.0 - Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, primarily used for uploading files.

## Project Structure

Here’s a brief overview of the project's directory structure:

```
